# Augmented Reality Card Counter

## Executive Summary

The Augmented Reality Card Counter is an augmented reality utility for use in smart accessories at poker tables. This ideally head-mounted program will systematically take note of what cards have been played, when they were played, and the order in the deck the remaining cards might be. 

## Business Objectives

The main objective for this project is to provide an easy and discrete way for miscreants to cheat while gambling. This will allow for casinos to feed the inherant crave-act-reward cycle ever present in human nature. In turn, this will stimulate local economy which will trickle upwards to the national level. 
This project will be finished on February 30th, 2021 with no further maintainence required afterwards. 

## Background

With the introduction of anti-gambling laws and addiction programs, casinos that are not in any location named "Las Vegas" are taking an economic hit. Without extorting the unfortunate realities of human addiction, the local economies will suffer, with the upper echelons of corrupt corporations following suit. This product will not only fuel the craving by constantly rewarding the user with a win, it will give casinos leverage against them to use as a debt collection tool.

## Scope

The project will include the following functionalities: image detection, card counting, probability algorithms, a backdoor for casinos to monitor, and empty promises. 

The project will not include any hardware or promises of privacy. 

## Functional requirements

Image detection capabilities: 
For image recognition, we will purchase the API by CHOOCH. This will save manpower and labor costs, completely cementing the fact that we do not care about the people working on this project. CHOOCH provides a REST API and recognizes objects in visual media. This includes during live video, which is what we will be doing by accessing the customer's camera without asking. 

Card counting, probability algorithms: 
We will be using a futuristic artifical AI to memorize how to count cards in accordance to [this guide](https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/how-to-count-cards/). Every time it gets something wrong, we will decut 25% of its total AI paycheck. In reality, it will never get paid, because we need to cut costs to pad the wallets of the executive suite. Also, because it is a software and not a people. 


Empty promises: 
const promise = new Promise();
const promise2 = new Promise();


## Personnel requirements

The team will consist of interns who will have to have 5+ years of professional experience and masters degrees in Business Analytics, Computer Science, and Ancient Greek History. 
We will have a total of 3 of them, and they will all be responsible for the total of the software. 

They will also be unpaid. 

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

### Phase 1 - November 20, 2019
Allocate resources
Set detailed plans
Build up ambitions
Fantasize about vacations
Develop Gantt Charts
Create Phase List


### Phase 2 - November 21, 2019
Procrastinate
Disappoint your boss
Get fired
Purchase licenses to use CHOOCH API

### Phase 3 - February 2020
Deliver project
Find out the customer wanted something else
Scrap everything and use Agile instead


## Assumptions

CHOOCH API is readily available for the right price. This will be the main source of the functionality of our product. Developing the AI for card counting will require the use of this API. 

## Limitations

Cost: Our budget is $0. 
Project motivation: Driven by the busy life of a 24 year old who is currently sick. 

## Risks

Main risk is if the person who is evaluating the project as a whole doesn't find the idea even a little amusing. 
This would cause a loss of time in finding someone who appreciates my sense of humor and lack of free time.
