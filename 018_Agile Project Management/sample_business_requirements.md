# Augmented Reality Card Counter

## Executive Summary

The Augmented Reality Card Counter is an augmented reality utility for use in smart accessories at poker tables. This ideally head-mounted program will systematically take note of what cards have been played, when they were played, and the order in the deck the remaining cards might be. 

## Business Objectives

The main objective for this project is to provide an easy and discrete way for miscreants to cheat while gambling. This will allow for casinos to feed the inherant crave-act-reward cycle ever present in human nature. In turn, this will stimulate local economy which will trickle upwards to the national level. 
This project will be finished on February 30th, 2021 with no further maintainence required afterwards. 

## Background

With the introduction of anti-gambling laws and addiction programs, casinos that are not in any location named "Las Vegas" are taking an economic hit. Without extorting the unfortunate realities of human addiction, the local economies will suffer, with the upper echelons of corrupt corporations following suit. This product will not only fuel the craving by constantly rewarding the user with a win, it will give casinos leverage against them to use as a debt collection tool.

## Scope

The project will include the following functionalities: image detection, card counting, probability algorithms, a backdoor for casinos to monitor, and empty promises. 

The project will not include any hardware or promises of privacy. 

## Functional requirements

Image detection capabilities: 
For image recognition, we will purchase the API by CHOOCH. This will save manpower and labor costs, completely cementing the fact that we do not care about the people working on this project. CHOOCH provides a REST API and recognizes objects in visual media. This includes during live video, which is what we will be doing by accessing the customer's camera without asking. 

Card counting: 
We will be using a futuristic artifical AI to memorize how to count cards in accordance to [this guide](https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/how-to-count-cards/)


## Personnel requirements

*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
